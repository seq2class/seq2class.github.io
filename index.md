## Course description

This course surveys formal ingredients that are used to build structured models of character and word sequences. We will unpack recent deep learning architectures that consider various kinds of latent structure, and see how they draw on earlier work in structured prediction, dimensionality reduction, Bayesian nonparametrics, multi-task learning, etc. We will also examine a range of strategies used for inference and learning in these models. Students will be expected to read recent papers and carry out a research project. [Applications or Analysis]

Prerequisites: EN.600/601.465/665 or permission. Prior coursework in statistics or machine learning is recommended. Students may wish to prepare for their choice of research project by taking EN.601.382 Deep Learning Lab at the same time.

## Requirements (details TBA soon)

* Scribing
* Homeworks
* Final project
* Tests (midterm and final?)

* Class participation
* Reading papers
