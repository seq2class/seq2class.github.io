## Course description

This course surveys formal ingredients that are used to build structured models of character and word sequences. We will unpack recent deep learning architectures that consider various kinds of latent structure, and see how they draw on earlier work in structured prediction, dimensionality reduction, Bayesian nonparametrics, multi-task learning, etc. We will also examine a range of strategies used for inference and learning in these models. Students will be expected to read recent papers and carry out a research project. [Applications or Analysis]

Prerequisites: EN.600/601.465/665 or permission. Prior coursework in statistics or machine learning is recommended. Students may wish to prepare for their choice of research project by taking EN.601.382 Deep Learning Lab at the same time.

## Requirements (details TBA soon)

* Scribing
* Homeworks
* Final project
* Tests (midterm and final?)
* Class participation
* Reading papers

## Recurring themes

In some sense, the point of the course is to explicitly show you the
collection of design choices that you face when building probabilistic
reasoning systems.  Your choices will affect (1) how well your models
fit the theory and the data, (2) the computational complexity of inference
and training, and (3) the difficulty of implementing the system.

* Training objectives
  * Joint vs. conditional
  * Loss-infused training (train a policy) vs. loss-infused decoding (train a model)
  * Forms of regularization
  * Smooth vs. non-smooth objectives
  * Convex vs. non-convex objectives
  * End-to-end vs. pipelined training
* Inference objectives
  * Maximization vs. summation; annealing
	* Search and sampling
	* Dual decomposition (for maximization)
    * Variational approximation (for summation)
* Modeling schemes
  * Global vs. local - and how local?  (= lookahead vs. heuristics)
  * Graph-based vs. transition-based (= subgraph features vs. history-based features)
  * Tractable vs. faithful models
  * Domain knowledge vs. generic architectures
* Types vs. tokens
  * Model structure
  * Weighting the training data
* Computational tricks of the trade and implementation know-how
